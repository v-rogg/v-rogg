Hey, I specialize in Micro "SaaS" based on automated data collection, analysis, and interactive visualization.

Building blocks of choice: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Svelte](https://kit.svelte.dev), [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), ... sometimes a little bit of [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Currently I am working on:
- [3:45 (ViertelVorVier)](viertelvorvier.app/): service to help you analyse your time management based on your calendar
- [Parley](https://heyparley.de/): community-oriented packing simulator to help you optimize your pack lists 
- [Accountability](): mobile app to help groups stay accountable for each other and reach common goals
