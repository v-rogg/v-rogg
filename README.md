Hey, I specialize in Micro "SaaS" based on automated data collection, analysis, and interactive visualization.

Building blocks of choice: [ðŸ¦€ Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [<img style="height: 15px" src="https://svelte.dev/favicon.png"> Svelte](https://kit.svelte.dev), [ðŸ§ª Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), ... sometimes a little bit of [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Besides my corporate job, I am currently working on:
